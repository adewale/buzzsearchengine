Add a list of common search operators on the front page. Consider making it an include so that it can be used on the front page and also on the results page in situations where there are no results that match the user's search terms. Perhaps I should just link to: http://www.google.com/buzz/101962829696981365403/7ZTUAe2z26H/some-BUZZ-search-info-for-the-masses-if-you-are

Add a JoinBuzz/FollowMeOnBuzz button to the front page.

Add a Follow button to the names of the people who have shared each item in the search results.

Add a profile search page which brings back profiles including the profile images and a Follow button.

Add a topic-based profile search which brings back profiles including the profile images and a Follow button.

Let people login with Buzz by going through the hybrid OpenId/OAuth flow (that should handle cookies for me) then show a strip at the top with their name + email + profile photo. Then when a logged in user searches use their access token to access the Buzz search API so that they access search features that require authorisation. Make this a discreet feature with a small login button in the top right of the screen.
